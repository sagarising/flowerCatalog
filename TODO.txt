make a folder name FlowerCat
make four web pages :::::
*index.html
*flower_1.htm
*flower_2.htm
*guest.htm

now we need three css files ::::::
*for index.html
*for flower pages
*for guest book page

we will have to make layout for each of the page.
We will choose the exact colour and images as provided in .odt file



we also need script.js file :::::
*for writing function that will run on  clicking form button

CSS for flowervase button on index.html:::::::
*It should hide for 2 secs when clicked
	It means we have to assign a function that will run when image is clicked.
	Write a function which can do so.

*guest page should have a form. and when the submit button is clicked a javscript function has to invoked which can append the text as entered in the form in the visiting list. 


*flower pages should have a link which can download .pdf file with the contents about the flower. We have to find out a way how to do so. We can give the link of pdf file and hope it is automatically downloaded.
